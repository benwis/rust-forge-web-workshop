# Exercise 12 - JS Integration

A common question I get is how do you interop with Javascript and access the 
Javascript API provided by the browser in Rust. 

## Browser and JS Integration Crates
### web-sys
This autogenerated create contains the entire JS browser API, handily converted 
into Rust functions and types. I often find myself in here when I want to access
 things the browser controls, like navigation, history, localStorage, and a 
whole lot more. 

The [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) are a fantastic resource to
 find what is available and get information on it, then you can find the Rust 
analogs in the [web_sys docs](https://docs.rs/web-sys/latest/web_sys/index.html).
### js-sys
This crate is hopeful to know about to manipulate the Rust JS analogues returned
 in web-sys. If you need to represent a JS `Object` or a `Promise`, or an 
`ArrayBuffer`, this is the crate to look in.

## Community Developed Crates
The good news is that, for a number of commonly used crates and utilities, 
community members have already written something.

### leptos-use
One of the most active and expansive crates, [leptos-use]() can simplify a 
number of tasks that otherwise would require `web-sys`. I'll often check here to
 see if they've implemented something before going to `web-sys` proper. It's 
not autogenerated, so if you have any ideas for contributions, feel free to 
reach out.

## Awesome Leptos
[Awesome Leptos](https://github.com/leptos-rs/awesome-leptos) is a community 
effort to list all of the crates and resources people have written or found. 
Check out the list to see if someone has already written a wrapper crate for 
that JS lib you need. One example is 
[`leptos-leaflet`](https://github.com/headless-studio/leptos-leaflet), a 
Rust wrapper for the [leaflet mapping library](https://leafletjs.com/).

## wasm-bindgen
The `wasm-bindgen` [crate](https://github.com/wasm-bindgen/wasm-bindgen) lets 
us call JS from Rust, and pass data back and forth. If the JS lib you need isn't
prepackaged in one of the resources mentioned above, you can write your own 
here. It's usually easier than you think, but it works best on pure JS 
libraries and not React specific ones.

## Exercise
Use the function from web-sys to create a quote button, to copy the selected 
text to the clipboard.
> Hint: `Document` has a `get_selection()` method on it in web-sys
